Here's a concise summary of the `home.test.js` file:

### **Home Component Test Summary**

#### **Test Coverage**
1. **UI Rendering**
   - Verifies the main heading "Schedule a Waste Pickup" renders correctly.

2. **Form Validation**
   - Tests error handling when required fields are missing.
   - Checks for proper error message display.

3. **Form Submission**
   - Validates successful form submission with all required fields.
   - Confirms success message appears after submission.

#### **Key Test Cases**

| Test Case | Description | Verification |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Renders heading** | Checks if the main heading appears | `Schedule a Waste Pickup` is visible |
| **Empty form submission** | Submits form without filling fields | Error message appears (`Please fill in all required fields`) |
| **Valid form submission** | Submits form with all required data | Success message appears (`Your waste pickup request has been submitted`) |

#### **Tested Form Fields**
- Full Name  
- Email  
- Pickup Location  
- Waste Type  
- Preferred Pickup Date  

#### **Testing Approach**
- Uses `@testing-library/react` for component rendering and DOM queries.  
- Simulates user interactions (`fireEvent`) for form input and submission.  
- Verifies both **error states** (missing fields) and **success states** (valid submission).  

#### **Key Features Verified**
âœ… Proper UI rendering  
âœ… Form validation logic  
âœ… Success flow handling  
âœ… User interaction simulation  

This test suite ensures the Home component's waste pickup form functions correctly under different user scenarios. ðŸš€
