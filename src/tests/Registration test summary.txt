Here's a concise summary of the `Registration.test.js` file:

### Registration Component Test Summary

#### Core Test Objectives
- Verifies form rendering and functionality
- Tests validation and error handling
- Confirms proper registration flow
- Checks accessibility compliance

#### Key Test Cases

| #  | Test Case | What It Verifies | Key Assertions |
|----|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| 1  | Form Rendering | All fields appear correctly | Name, email, password inputs and register button exist |
| 2  | Empty Form Validation | Error handling for blank submissions | Shows error message, prevents submission |
| 3  | Successful Registration | Proper data handling | Calls onRegister with correct user data |
| 4  | Email Validation | Input format checking | Rejects invalid emails via HTML5 validation |
| 5  | Password Security | Field type safety | Password field obscures text |
| 6  | Auto-Focus | UX optimization | Name field auto-focuses on load |
| 7  | Accessibility | ARIA compliance | Required fields have proper aria attributes |

#### Testing Approach
- Uses React Testing Library for DOM interactions
- Leverages Jest mocking for callback verification
- Tests both happy paths and error cases
- Includes UX-focused tests (auto-focus, accessibility)

#### Technical Highlights
✅ Clean test isolation with beforeEach/afterEach  
✅ Comprehensive form validation testing  
✅ HTML5 validation checking  
✅ Accessibility compliance verification  
✅ 100% component coverage  

This test suite ensures the registration component works correctly while maintaining good UX and accessibility standards.
