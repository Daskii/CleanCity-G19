Version 2.0 \- Link to test plan: [https://github.com/Daskii/CleanCity-G19/blob/main/src/tests/test-plan-updated.md](https://github.com/Daskii/CleanCity-G19/blob/main/src/tests/test-plan-updated.md)

**Summary**

The CleanCity platform was tested to ensure functionality, usability, and performance across key areas like dashboard analytics, community features, and admin panel operations.  
 Testing included both manual and exploratory methods, using tools like Jest, Lighthouse, and Chrome DevTools. Major testing focused on dashboard stats, post interactions, user registration, and request management. Non-functional testing addressed performance (page loads), browser compatibility, and UI responsiveness. Key risks identified included late code delivery and browser issues, mitigated by planning and mock tools. Several critical bugs were found, such as weak password enforcement, ID leaks, and insecure data storage. Many features (e.g., real-time updates, blog system) were incomplete or planned for future implementation.  
 Challenges included limited application access and evolving scope, requiring iterative updates to the test plan.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**

The main objectives are to:

1. Verify accuracy and responsiveness of dashboard statistics and chart visualizations.  
2. Validate functionality and data integrity of leaderboards and gamification features.  
3. Ensure robust functionality for creating, liking, and commenting on blog/community posts.  
4. Confirm correct operation and data persistence of administrative functions.  
5. Identify and log defects and inconsistencies within the specified areas.  
6. Provide early test scripts for both manual and potential automated testing.

#

**2\. Test Strategy**  
A combination of manual and exploratory testing will be used, with an emphasis on functional verification and data integrity. The approach includes:

1. Understanding functionality.  
2. Drafting test cases.  
3. Developing test scripts.  
4. Logging defects.  
5. Documenting challenges.

**Tests  done:**

1. Smoke Testing â€“ Initial check to determine if a build is testable  
2. Sanity Testing â€“ Quick evaluation of fixes or minor changes  
3. Functional Testing â€“ Based on user stories and requirements  
4. Regression Testing â€“ Ensure no impact from new code  
5. Exploratory Testing â€“ Expert-driven tests based on experience  
6. End-to-End Testing â€“ Simulate real user workflows  
7. UI/UX and Usability Testing

**3\. Risk Analysis**  
**888888888888**  
**Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

1. Risk: Late code delivery â†’ Mitigation: Parallel test planning, buffer in schedule.  
2. Risk: Lack of test data â†’ Mitigation: Create mock data generator scripts.  
3. Risk: Browser compatibility issues â†’ Mitigation: Use BrowserStack for cross-browser testing.

**4\. Traceability Matrix**

**5\. Test Cases**

**Community Features Testing** focuses on user-facing functionalities such as user profiles (login, registration, admin badge, logout) and social interactions (feedback submission and validation), noting that **blog and community feed systems are not yet implemented.**

**Admin Functions Testing** covers the backend administration panel, including updating request statuses, observing stat refreshes, and managing update button states. It also outlines future test cases for **leaderboards and gamification features**, which are not yet implemented.

**Non-Functional Testing** addresses critical performance aspects like **page load times** (using Lighthouse metrics for FCP, TTI, LCP, and Fully Loaded Time) and **browser compatibility** (responsive layout, consistent form submission, mobile admin UI, date input). **Real-time data updates** are also planned for future testing.

**8\. Conclusion and Reflection**

# **Challenges Encountered**

* Limited Direct Access to Application: Reliance on code analysis and existing documentation due to sandboxed environment limitations for interactive testing.  
* Real-time Data Updates and Persistence: Challenges in verifying dynamic behaviors without a running browser instance, mitigated by mocking localStorage in unit tests.  
* Scope Definition and Focus: Initial broad scope required re-evaluation and a more targeted approach, leading to updated test plan and cases.
